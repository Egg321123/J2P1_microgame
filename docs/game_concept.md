# Gameplay ideas

## Constraints
- Android (mobile)
- Use phone specific controls?
- Theme: microgame
- Theme: show data
- Needs to be quick to play, easy to put down again.

## Progressions
- Idea for progress similar to Cookie Clicker (incremental permanent progress).
- Gacha? (reason to keep returning)
- Achievements
- Score (3 stars)
- Levels van user/characters
- Game levels (probably not, takes a lot of dev time)
- Skill tree (give the player more choice)

## Game styles
- Clicker *
- Puzzle **
- Tower defense ***

## Games to reference
- WarioWare
- Cookie clicker
- Battle cats

# Game concept

## Genre: rouge-lite tower defense (progression between deaths)

## Levels:
- Levels are randomly generated.
- Levels are infinite (using a seed-based system using level as seed).
- No real progression (doesn’t feel harder).
- Every new level your money is reset to a set amount for that level.

## Waves:
- Every level is 10 waves

- ### Buying - placing - battle
  - During the buying phase you can buy units/towers (you cannot change the towers you bought during the battle phase).
  - During the placing phase you can place your towers (towers can only be moved in the battle phase by sacrificing currency used in buying phase).
  - During the battle phase you can’t do anything unless you have leftover currency from the buying phase (you can still mover the towers).

- ### Wave lose behavior:
  - Keep all the money you currently still have.
  - Losing “resets” you back to wave 1.

- ### Wave Win behavior:
  - Go to next wave.

## Towers:
  - Different types of tower (with different abilities)
  - towers can be destroyed but only by specific enemies (like exploding enemies)

## Enemies:
  - Defeating enemies rewards a random number of coins dependent on its type.
  - Different types of enemies (can explode, slow tower rate of fire, etc).

## Important:
  - Save data every wave (save positions, level, etc).
  - properly show the path the ai (enemies) take.

## UPS:
 - infinite gameplay with random levels and challenging gameplay.
