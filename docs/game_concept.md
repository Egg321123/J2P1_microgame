# Gameplay ideas

## Constraints
- Android (mobile)
- Use phone specific controls?
- Theme: microgame
- Theme: show data
- Needs to be quick to play, easy to put down again.

## Progressions
- Idea for progress similar to Cookie Clicker (incremental permanent progress).
- Gacha? (reason to keep returning)
- Achievements
- Score (3 stars)
- Levels van user/characters
- Game levels (probably not, takes a lot of dev time)
- Skill tree (give the player more choice)

## Game styles
- Clicker *
- Puzzle **
- Tower defense ***

## Games to reference
- WarioWare
- Cookie clicker
- Battle cats

# Game concept
- Genre: rouge-lite tower defense (progression between deaths)

## Data to show:
-	Level
-	Tower level (above tower)
-	Enemies killed (total)
-	Towers placed (total)
-	Upgrades done to towers (total)
-	Total amount of money earned
-	Total amount of money spent
-	Money dropped by enemy (shown where enemy was when it died)

## Current actions:
-	Placing (purchases that tower)
-	Clicking continue (continues wave)
-	Click to upgrade (click on towers to upgrade them)

## Levels:
-	Every level will be a new (seed-based) randomly generated level.
-	When you go to the next level, the map gets cleared of towers.
-	Remove the persons money every new level.

## Waves: 
-	Every level is 10 waves

## Buying - placing - battle
-	During the buying and placing phase you can buy towers. (you see 4 of them at random) and place them from the purchase menu (click shop, place to purchase), you can click continue to continue
-	During the battle phase you can upgrade your towers by clicking on them, after wave is done, you go back into buying phase.

## Wave lose behavior:
-	Same behavior as going to the next level, but you restart at the start of this level (basically luck-based if you progress, no pity)

## Wave Win behavior:
-	Go to next wave

## Towers:
-	Click to upgrade
-	Multiple different towers

## Enemies:
-	Multiple types of enemies
-	rewards a random number of coins dependent on its type
-	Show amount of money dropped by enemy

## Important:
-	Save data every wave (save positions, level, etc).
