# Gameplay ideas

## Constraints
- Android (mobile)
- Use phone specific controls?
- Theme: microgame
- Theme: show data
- Needs to be quick to play, easy to put down again.

# Game concept
- Genre: tower defense.

## Data to show:
- currrent level.
- Tower level (above tower).
- Enemies killed (both this level, and total).
- Towers placed (both this level, and total).
- amount of upgrades done to towers (both this level, and total).
- Total amount of money earned (both this level, and total).
- Total amount of money spent (both this level, and total).
- Money dropped by enemy (shown where enemy was when it died).
- keep track of how many levels have been finished in 1 go (and show when completed level).

## Current actions:
- Placing (purchases that tower).
- Clicking continue (continues wave).
- Click to upgrade (click on towers to upgrade them).

## Levels:
- Every level will be a new (seed-based) randomly generated level.
- When you go to the next level, the map gets cleared of towers.
- Remove the persons money every new level.
- Reward player extra money for the next level if the player won this level in one go.

## Waves: 
- Every level is 10 waves.

## Buying - placing - battle
- During the buying and placing phase you can buy towers. (you see 4 of them at random) and place them from the purchase menu (click shop, place to purchase), you can click continue to continue.
- During the battle phase you can upgrade your towers by clicking on them, after wave is done, you go back into buying phase.

## Wave lose behavior:
- Same behavior as going to the next level, but you restart at the start of this level (basically luck-based if you progress, no pity).

## Wave Win behavior:
- Go to next wave.

## Towers:
- differently sized towers? (1x1, 1x2, 2x2).
- Click to upgrade.
- Multiple different towers.

## Enemies:
- Multiple types of enemies
- rewards a random number of coins dependent on its type.
- Show amount of money dropped by enemy.

## Important:
- Save data every wave (save positions, level, etc).
